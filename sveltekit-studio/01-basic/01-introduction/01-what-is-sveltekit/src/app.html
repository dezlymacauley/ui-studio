      `style="display: contents"` is used to make this div 
      act as a hydration anchor.

      What this means in simple terms is that the content 
      of the specific `+page.svelte` file for each route will be treated
      as if it was directly placed inside the <body></body> html element.

      The div itself still exists in the DOM, but it doesn't affect 
      layout, CSS, or semantics.
